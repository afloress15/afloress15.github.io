My Github account username is afloress15, the account was simple to set up and I as of now only have one README file created.

The repository I created is named afloress15.github.io. I faced some difficulties when attempting to connect my repository to my visual studio code, I had to watch a couple videos in order to fully understand what the process was.

In order to clone the repository onto my local machine, I went to the gitub website and first created my repoository. I then clicked on the green "code" button and clicked open with github desktop after installing the desktop version.
